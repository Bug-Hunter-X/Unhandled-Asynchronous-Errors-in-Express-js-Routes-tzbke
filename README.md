# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Express.js Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled asynchronous errors within route handlers.  Improper error handling can lead to silent failures, making debugging difficult.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation. If this operation throws an error, the error is caught within the `.catch` block, but it's not properly handled in the context of the Express response. This results in the application continuing to run without notifying the client about the error.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. It uses a `try...catch` block to handle the asynchronous operation's potential errors. If an error occurs, a proper error response is sent to the client, enhancing the application's robustness and providing better user feedback.
